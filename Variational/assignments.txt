1) Complete the implementation of the gradient descent approach in grad_desc_assignment.m

2) Compare the result with the ones obtained by the implementation of the more sophisticated
   method in Bresson.m.

3) Uncomment lines 33-34 in grad_desc_assignment.m and lines 42-43 in Bresson.m - what happens and why?

4) Change the stepsize as well as the regularization parameter in grad_desc_assignment.m - what happens?

5) Visualize the computed gradient - can the explain what you observe?

6) Change the initialization of all two implementations- what happens?
